# Sabatier_Rxn
Investigation of Sabatier Reaction using 0D Simulation


This project was completed for ME370A: "Energy Systems I: Thermodynamics" at Stanford University. The Cantera simulation was a joint effort between Henry Hanlon and Ivana Chen. Additional contributors to the presentation were David Wu, Yuxuan Li, Bryan Hwang and Sho Wada.


This simulation used the GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanism in a 0-D reactor in order to find the equilibrium compositions of the Sabatier Reaction vs temperature, pressure and molar ratio.
